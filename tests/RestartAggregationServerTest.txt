RESTART AGGREGATION SERVER TEST
This test will simulate an aggregation server restarting after a crash.
After a crash, the server files (LAMPORT_AGGREGATION_SERVER.txt, PID_COUNTER.txt, weather.json and cs#_p#.json files) should still be in the root directory.
When the aggregation server is restarted, the server files will be used to reinitialise the aggregation server's lamport clock and database.
This ensures the server does not lose data when it crashes and can continue to run.


- To run the test, ensure that you have compiled the code following the Compilation instructions.

- In the root directory, delete the following files if they exist: 
(This is because the auto-delete only works when the server shutdowns normally. During testing we may interrupt the server using CTRL-C, hence these files may not be deleted.)
    - cs#_p#.json files (where # is a number)
    - LAMPORT_AGGREGATION_SERVER.txt
    - PID_COUNTER.txt
    - weather.json

- To start the aggregation server, run the following command in a terminal window:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:DataUtil:LogUtil:RequestInformation.java:LamportClock.java:Response.java:Listener.java:Handler.java AggregationServer.java 4567

The output should be:
Aggregation server starting up, listening at port 4567
You can access http://localhost:4567 now.

- In another terminal, start a content server using the following commands.
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java:WeatherEntry.java ContentServer.java http://localhost:4567 1 cs1_1.txt

followed by:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java:WeatherEntry.java ContentServer.java http://localhost:4567 1 cs1_2.txt

The output for the first command should be:
New PID Allocated: 1

- Enter CTRL+C to terminate the aggregation server. This simulates the server crashing.

- Start the aggregation server again, with the following command:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:DataUtil:LogUtil:RequestInformation.java:LamportClock.java:Response.java:Listener.java:Handler.java AggregationServer.java 4567

The output should be:
Aggregation server restarted, listening at port 4567
You can access http://localhost:4567 now.

- The weather.json file should contain:
