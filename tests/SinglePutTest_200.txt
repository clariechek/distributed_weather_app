SINGLE PUT TEST - 200 OK
This test performs 1 PUT request where this is a subsequent connection from the content server, hence a 200 OK response code is expected to be returned.

- To run the test, ensure that you have compiled the code following the Compilation instructions.

- In the project root directory, run the main method in DeleteFiles.java. Then delete any cs#_p#.json files (where # is a number).
This will delete the following files:
    - cs#_p#.json files (where # is a number)
    - LAMPORT_AGGREGATION_SERVER.txt
    - PID_COUNTER.txt
    - weather.json
This is because the auto-delete only works when the server shutdowns normally. During testing we may interrupt the server using CTRL+C, hence these files may not be deleted.


- To start the aggregation server, run the following command in a terminal window:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:DataUtil:LogUtil:RequestInformation.java:LamportClock.java:Response.java:Listener.java:Handler.java AggregationServer.java 4567

The output should be:
Aggregation server starting up, listening at port 4567
You can access http://localhost:4567 now.

- In another terminal, start a content server using the following commands.
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java:WeatherEntry.java ContentServer.java http://localhost:4567 1 cs1_1.txt

followed by:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java:WeatherEntry.java ContentServer.java http://localhost:4567 1 cs1_2.txt

The output for the first command should be:
New PID Allocated: 1
Connected to localhost on port 4567
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 734
Connnection: close
