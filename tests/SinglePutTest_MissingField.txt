SINGLE PUT TEST - Missing fields
This test performs 1 PUT request where the data from the content server is missing the id field, hence an error is expected to be returned.

- To run the test, ensure that you have compiled the code following the Compilation instructions.

- In the root directory, delete the following files if they exist: 
(This is because the auto-delete only works when the server shutdowns normally. During testing we may interrupt the server using CTRL-C, hence these files may not be deleted.)
    - cs#_p#.json files (where # is a number)
    - LAMPORT_AGGREGATION_SERVER.txt
    - PID_COUNTER.txt
    - weather.json

- To start the aggregation server, run the following command in a terminal window:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:DataUtil:LogUtil:RequestInformation.java:LamportClock.java:Response.java:Listener.java:Handler.java AggregationServer.java 4567

The output should be:
Aggregation server starting up, listening at port 4567
You can access http://localhost:4567 now.

- In another terminal, start a content server using the following command.
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java:WeatherEntry.java ContentServer.java http://localhost:4567 3 cs3_2.txt

The output should be:
New PID Allocated: 1
Error: Invalid file format. Missing id field.
Error: Invalid content

- Enter CTRL+C to terminate the aggregation server.
