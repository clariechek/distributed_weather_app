SINGLE GET TEST - No data
This test performs a single GET request on an empty database. Hence, a 404 Not Found response code is returned.

- To run the test, ensure that you have compiled the code following the Compilation instructions.

- In the root directory, delete the following files if they exist: 
(This is because the auto-delete only works when the server shutdowns normally. During testing we may interrupt the server using CTRL-C, hence these files may not be deleted.)
    - cs#_p#.json files (where # is a number)
    - LAMPORT_AGGREGATION_SERVER.txt
    - PID_COUNTER.txt
    - weather.json

- To start the aggregation server, run the following command in a terminal window:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:DataUtil:LogUtil:RequestInformation.java:LamportClock.java:Response.java:Listener.java:Handler.java AggregationServer.java 4567

The output should be:
Aggregation server starting up, listening at port 4567
You can access http://localhost:4567 now.

- In another terminal, start the GETClient using the following command:
java -cp .:java-json.jar:LamportClock.java GETClient.java http://localhost:4567 1

The output should be:
New PID Allocated: 1
Connected to localhost on port 4567
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Is content length 0: true
Content-Length: 0
Connnection: close



Data for station ID 1 is not found in database.

- Enter CTRL+C to terminate the aggregation server.

The aggregation server output should be:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: application/json
StationID: 1
LamportTimestamp: 1
ProcessID: 1
